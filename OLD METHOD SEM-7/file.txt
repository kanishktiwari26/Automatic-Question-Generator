Osmosis is the movement of a solvent across a semipermeable membrane toward a higher concentration of solute.


In biological systems, the solvent is typically water,
but osmosis can occur in other liquids, supercritical liquids, and even gases.


When a cell is submerged in water, the water molecules pass through the cell membrane
from an area of low solute concentration to high solute concentration.
